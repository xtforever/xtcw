# xtcw

This project allows you to write Xt based Widget Sets with Modern Fontconfig 
and optional Cairo Drawing and resource file based gui builder. This is not a 
replacement for QT or GTK. Instead it allows you to write one. 

Part of this project is wbuild an other project designed to help building widgets. It has nice feature like automatic documentation generation.

For now you need to build wbuild first. 


Wbuild maintainer were:
* Bert Bos <bert@let.rug.nl>  
* Joel N. Weber II <devnull@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

Wbuild is available from either
ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/fwf
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu
