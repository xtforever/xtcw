Proposal

With debug enabled:
make -C tool

Without debug:
make -C tool debug_flag=0


make -C wbuild
make -C xtcw static
make -C xtcw shared

Task: deploy application
      Nothing special
      you need libxtcw.so and your own executeable


Task: compile application with externaly installed xtcw-dev tree
xtcw-dev=/usr/local
make
              lib       =/usr/local/lib/libxctw.so
              include   =/usr/local/include/xtcw
              bin       =/usr/local/bin/wbuild
              wbuildcf  =/usr/local/include/xtcw

xtcw-dev:
              exec:        wbuild
              lib:         libxtcw.so
              cf:          wbuild.ini
              include:     name.widget
                           name.h
                           nameP.h
                           name.3
                           other.h
                           otherP.h



Task: compile application inside xtcw tree

xtcw-dev=~/src/xtcw
build=$(xtcw-dev)/build
include=-I$(xtcw-dev)/wcl -I$(xtcw-dev)/widgets -I$(build)/include/xtcw/

1) build wbuild local
2) create widget source
3) compile xtcw
4) link libxtcw
5) compile example
6) link example
