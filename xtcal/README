Simply type "make" to build, or "make debug=1" to get additional info.
To rebuild the Calib widget you'll need wbuild.
xtcal will try to go fullscreen, if this doesn't work you need to run with:
xtcal -geometry <Width>x<Height>

1) start "xtcal" and you get a list of attached devices, search for your touchscreen.

2) start "xtcal -deviceName "my touch screen" and you get a red cross.
   (if not try: xtcal -deviceName "my touch screen" -geometry 1280x1024 or whatever your
    screen resolution is.)
   click on the center of the cross

3) you see 9 numbers - this is your coordinate transformation matrix

4) on boot apply the matrix with:
   xtcal -deviceName "my touch screen" -geometry 1280x102 -matrix "1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1"
